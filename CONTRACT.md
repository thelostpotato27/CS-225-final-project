## CS 225 Final Project - Team Contract
## (vvrao2, pmm6, colincl2, jdchang3)
### Communication
#### Team Meetings
Our team will meet regularly via Discord voice chat, as well as in person when time permits. Our default meeting times will be weekly on Sundays at 2 PM, but we can reschedule as necessary using Discord, as well as add additional meeting times. Venkat (vvrao2) will take meeting notes and update the development log during/before meetings. Each meeting will last for 2-3 hours.
#### Assistance
In order for teammates to contact each other for help, we can either visit each other in person (three of us are roommates), or use Discord DMs. Teammates should respond to Discord DMs within 24 hours, but realistically a 3-4 hour response time is expected.
#### Decision Making
All decisions will be made through group collaborative discussion, and hopefully a unanimous vote afterwards. If unresolvable disagreements do arise, then a simple plurality will decide the vote.
### Collaboration
#### Work Distribution
Each group member will be responsible for a different component of the completed project. These categories are not rigid (we expect to still collaborate on each component and help each other debug), but are meant to give a general idea of what each person is responsible for.
- Patrick (pmm6) - Data Gathering
- Jeffrey (jdchang3) - Data Processing
- Colin (colincl2) - Graph Implementation
- Venkat (vvrao2) - Visualization and I/O, Logistics
#### Time Commitment
Each team member is expected to spend 2-7 hours a week on the final project. If a certain part of the project is taking more time than expected, other team members will attempt to assist the struggling member by debugging and helping write code. If a member is contributing much less than expected after repeated discussions, then additional action may be taken such as notifying our staff mentor. It is the individual's responsibility to make sure their deliverable is finished by the end of the week, but other team members are expected to help struggling members.
#### Conflict Resolution
If there is for some reason a tie between two groups of two, a coin flip will be the tiebreaker. (If for some reason all four people want to make different decisions, we will flip two coins to decide.) By signing this contract, all members agree that decisions made by the processes outlined herein are binding.
